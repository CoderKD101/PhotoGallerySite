# PhotoGallerySite
This is my first web development project, a photography website to showcase and share beautiful images. It features a user-friendly interface with a responsive design to display high-quality photos. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it serves as my personal portfolio and provides a smooth browsing experience.
