         <ol> <li><p> <h4>Choose the Right Editing App</h4>
            There are countless editing apps available, but some of the most popular ones are:
            <ul>
                <li> Snapseed: A versatile app with tools for everything from basic adjustments to advanced edits.</li>
            <li>Adobe Lightroom Mobile: Ideal for professional-quality edits with precise control over lighting and color.</li>
           <li>VSCO: Great for filters and creating a consistent aesthetic.</li>
            </ul>
            Pick one that suits your style and experiment!</p></li> 

           <li>
            <p>
                <h4>Start with Basic Adjustments</h4>
                Before diving into filters or effects, begin with the basics:
                <ul>
                <li>Brightness: Adjust to make the photo clearer. Avoid overexposing details.</li>
                <li>Contrast: Boost contrast to add depth to your image.</li>
                <li>Crop and Straighten: Remove unwanted elements and align your photo properly.</li>
                <li>Sharpening: Make details stand out, especially in landscape or architecture shots.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
           </li> 

           <li>
            <p>
                <h4>Play with Colors</h4>
                Color adjustments can completely transform your photo:
               <ul>
                <li>Saturation: Increase it for vibrant colors or reduce it for a subtle look.</li>
                <li>Temperature: Make the photo warmer or cooler to match the mood.</li>
                <li>Hue: Change specific colors to enhance the overall aesthetic.</li>
               </ul>
                 For example, turn dull skies into vibrant blue. 
            </p>
           </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <h4>Master Highlights and Shadows</h4>
                    Fine-tuning highlights and shadows helps balance your image:
            <ul>
                <li>Highlights: Lower them to recover details in bright areas.</li>
                <li>Shadows: Brighten them to reveal details in darker parts.</li>
            </ul>
            This adjustment is particularly useful for outdoor or night photography. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                  <h3>  Use Filters Wisely </h3>
                   Filters can give your photos a unique vibe, but don’t overdo them.
           <ul>
            <li>Use subtle filters to enhance the mood of the photo.</li>
                <li>Customize the intensity of filters to keep your image natural.</li>
           </ul>
            Apps like VSCO and Lightroom let you tweak filters for a balanced look. 
                </p>
            </li>

             <li>
                <p>
                     <h4>Dodge and Burn</h4>
            Dodge (brightening) and burn (darkening) specific areas to direct focus in your photo. <br> For instance,
            brighten a
            subject’s face or darken the background for contrast. Many apps, like Snapseed, have tools for this.
                </p>
             </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <h4> Experiment with Perspective and Depth</h4>
                    <ul>
            <li>Perspective correction: Straighten lines in architecture shots to make them more appealing.</li>
            <li>Blur effect: Use apps to simulate depth-of-field and make the subject pop.</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <h4> Add Textures or Effects</h4>
            For creative projects, you can add textures, grain, or light leaks:
            <ul>
                <li>Grain adds a vintage film look.</li>
                <li>Light leaks or flares can enhance outdoor or portrait shots for a dreamy feel.</li>
            </ul>
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                    <h4>Save Your Edits as Presets</h4>
            If you often edit in the same style, save your settings as presets (available in Lightroom and VSCO).  <br>This
            will speed up editing and maintain consistency across your photos. 
                </p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <p>
                  <h4>Always Save a Copy</h4>  
            When editing, save the original photo and the edited version separately. <br> This allows you to revisit the
            original if needed or try different styles later.
                </p>
            </li> </ol>  

        <p> <h3>Conclusion</h3>
